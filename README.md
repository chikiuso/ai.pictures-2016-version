# ai.pictures-2016-version

Hi, I created this script in 2016 and it finally made over 70000 video and published on 15 languages youtube channels, and finally accumulated over 70 million views.

You will see the code is a little bit messy. It nows doesn't work as some libraries is changed or dropped (of course you could modify and replace with modern libraries to make it work again). I uploaded here for inspiring somebody in this little planet for further development, thanks.

Best Regards,
